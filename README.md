ASA Backup Manager is a tool to automaticaly backup ARK: Survival Ascended world files.

You can add your world files via the 'right-click' context menu then browse to find your .ARK file

Once added you can specify the number of backup files you wish to keep and as backups occur the oldest
will be deleted as needed. The backup files are saved in the same folder as the .ARK file and are 
embedded in a .ZIP file along with any .ARKProflie and .ARKTribe files in the same folder. 

There is no need to configure the frequenycy of the backup, a fresh backup will occur automatically
every time the world is saved (default of 15 minutes). 

While ASABM was intended for servers it SHOULD work to back up your single player worlds but has only
been lighlty tested using the Steam version of ASA. It MIGHT also work for ASE games but has not
been validated. 

ASA Backup Manager requires Microsoft .Net 4.7.2 or higher to run and has been tested on both
Windows 10 and Windows 11.
